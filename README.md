# Ethereum Connect

Welcome to ethereum-connect, a tiny front-end project which demonstrates how to perform various functions on the Ethereum network via Metamask.

I've tried to keep this project as simple as possible, I'm not using any front-end frameworks like React.js and everything is written in plain javascript.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the demo.

## Chapters

I've broken up the project into chapters and tagged each one as follows:

- **[1.0.0]** Connect to Metamask and get address of user.
